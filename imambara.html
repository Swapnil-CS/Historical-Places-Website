		<p>
			Hooghly Imambara is a Shia Muslim congregation hall and mosque in Hooghly,
			West Bengal, India. The construction of the building was started by
			Muhammad Mohsin in 1841 and completed in 1861. The building is a two
			storied structure, with a tall clock tower over the entrance gate. The
			mosque has intricate designs and texts from Quran engraved on the wall.
			The interior of the mosque is decorated with marbles, candles and hanging
			lanterns.

		<h2>Clock</h2>
		<p>
			Hooghly Imambara is famous for its vaunted clock. It is at the middle of
			the twin towers constructed on the doorway of the main entrance. Each
			tower, having a height of approximately 150 ft., takes 152 steps to reach
			its top. The clock has two dials with three bells having weight 80 mds, 40
			mds and 30 mds. Smaller bells ring at an interval of 15 minutes and bigger
			bell rings to signify one hour. The clock requires two people to wind it
			for half an hour of each week, with a key weighing 20 kg. It was bought
			for Rs. 11,721 (in 1852) by Syed Keramat Ali from the manufacturer: M/s
			Black & Hurray Co., Big Ben, London.

		<h2>Location</h2>
		<p>
			It is in Hooghly District. People coming from Kolkata have to take a train
			(Local or Express) to Naihati Junction. From Naihati, they have to catch
			the Bandel Local train and they get off at Hooghly Ghat Station. From
			there, Imambara is in a walking distance. There are rickshaws and autos to
			ferry visitors to the Imambara from the station. Or, the best way to come
			possibly is to go to Howrah Station and avail the straight trains (local
			EMUs) to Bandel, which are more frequent and less crowded. One needs to
			get down at Hooghly Station, and take autos/totos/rickshaws to the
			Imambara. Visitors should carry their own lunch/snacks, since there are no
			eateries around the Imambara.
