		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			The Cooch Behar Rajbari, noted for its elegance and grandeur, is a
			property of The Mantri's. It is a brick-built double-story structure in
			the classical Western style covering an area of 51,309 square feet
			(4,766.8 m2). The whole structure is 395 feet (120 m) long and 296 feet
			(90 m) wide and is on rests 4 feet 9 inches (1.45 m) above the ground. The
			Palace is fronted on the ground and first floors by a series of arcaded
			verandahs with their piers arranged alternately in single and double rows.
			During the reign of Maharaja Harendra Narayan, the capital was shifted
			from Dhaluabari Palace to Cooch Behar Palace in 1828.

		<h2>Architecture</h2>

		<p>
			At the southern and northern ends, the Palace projects slightly and in the
			center is a projected porch providing an entrance to the Durbar Hall. The
			Hall has an elegantly shaped metal dome which is topped by a cylindrical
			louver type ventilator. This is 124 feet (38 m) high from the ground and
			is in the style of the Renaissance architecture. The intros of the dome is
			carved in stepped patterns and Corinthian columns support the base of the
			cupola. This adds variegated colors and designs to the entire surface.
			There are various halls in the palace and rooms that include the Dressing
			Room, Bed Room, Drawing Room, Dining Hall, Billiard hall, Library,
			Toshakhana, Ladies Gallery and Vestibules. The articles and precious
			objects that these rooms and halls used to contain are now lost.
			<br />
			The original palace was 3 storeyed, but was subsequently destroyed by the
			1897 Assam earthquake.
			<br />
			The palace shows the acceptance of European idealism of the Koch kings and
			the fact that they had embraced European culture without denouncing their
			Indian heritage.
			<br />
			According to the List of Monuments of National Importance in West Bengal
			the Cooch Behar Palace is an ASI listed monument.
