		</center>
		<img src="Belur math.jpg" />
		<p>
			Belur Math (pronounced ['beluɽ 'mɔʈʰ]) is the headquarters of the
			Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, founded by Swami Vivekananda,
			the chief disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. It is located on the west
			bank of Hooghly River, Belur, West Bengal, India and is one of the
			significant institutions in Kolkata. The temple is the heart of the
			Ramakrishna movement. It is notable for its architecture that fuses Hindu,
			Islamic, Buddhist, and Christian art and motifs as a symbol of unity of
			all religions. In 2003, Belur Math railway station was also inaugurated
			which is dedicated to Belur Math Temple.
			<br />
		</p>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			In the beginning of 1897, Swami Vivekananda arrived in Baranagar, Calcutta
			with his small group of Western disciples. Two monasteries were founded by
			him, one at Belur, which became the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission
			and the other at Mayavati on the Himalayas, in Champawat District,
			Uttrakhand, called the Advaita Ashrama. These monasteries were meant to
			receive and train young men who would eventually become sannyasis
			(religious ascetic) of the Ramakrishna Mission, and to give them a
			training for their work. The same year the philanthropic activity was
			started and relief of the famine was carried out.
			<br />
			Swami Vivekananda's days as a parivrajaka (wandering monk) before his
			visit to Parliament of Religions, took him through many parts of India,
			and he visited several architectural monuments like the Taj Mahal,
			Fatehpur Sikri palaces, Diwan-I-Khas, palaces of Rajasthan, ancient
			temples of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other places.
			During his tour in America and Europe, he came across buildings of
			architectural importance of Modern, Medieval, Gothic and Renaissance
			styles. It is reported that Vivekananda incorporated these ideas in the
			design of the Belur Math temple.
			<br />
			Swami Vijnanananda, a brother-monk of Swami Vivekananda and one of the
			monastic disciples of Ramakrishna, who was, in his pre-monastic life, a
			civil engineer, designed the temple according to the ideas of Vivekananda
			and Swami Shivananda, the then President of Belur Math laid the foundation
			stone on 13 March 1929. The massive construction was handled by Martin
			Burn & Co. The mission proclaims the Belur Math as, "A Symphony in
			Architecture". The Math can be reached by direct EMU train services from
			Howrah, ferry and by road.

		<h2>Campus</h2>
		<p>
			The 40-acre (160,000 m2) campus of the Belur Math on the banks of the
			Hooghly includes temples dedicated to Ramakrishna, Sarada Devi and Swami
			Vivekananda, in which their relics are enshrined, and the main monastery
			of the Ramakrishna Order. The campus also houses a Museum containing
			articles connected with the history of Ramakrishna Math and Mission.
			Several educational institutions affiliated with the Ramakrishna Mission
			are situated in the vast campus adjacent to Belur Math. The Belur Math is
			considered one of the prime tourist spots near Kolkata and place of
			pilgrimage by devotees. The ex-president APJ Abdul Kalam regarded Belur
			Math as a "place of heritage and national importance."
			<br />
		</p>
		<h2>Sri Ramakrishna Temple</h2>
		<p>
			The design of the temple was envisioned by Swami Vivekananda and the
			architect was Swami Vijnanananda, a direct monastic disciple of
			Ramakrishna. Sri Ramakrishna Temple was consecrated on 14 January, the
			Makar Sankranti Day in 1938.
			<br />
			The Ramakrishna temple at the Belur Math is designed to "celebrate the
			diversity of Indian Religions" and resembles a temple, a mosque, a church
			if seen from different positions. The architectural style and symbolism
			from a number of religions have been incorporated into the design of the
			temple at Belur Math, to convey the "universal faith" in which the
			movement believes. The temple is considered a prime example of the
			importance of "material dimension" of religion.
			<br />
		</p>

		<h2>Swami Vivekananda Temple</h2>

		<p>
			The Swami Vivekananda Temple stands on the spot where Swami Vivekananda's
			mortal remains were cremated in 1902. Consecrated on 28 January 1924, the
			temple has in its upper storey an alabaster OM (in Bengali characters).
			Beside the temple stands a bel (bilva) tree in the place of the original
			bel tree under which Swami Vivekananda used to sit and near which,
			according to his wish, his body was cremated. On 4 July 1902 at Belur
			Math, he taught Vedanta philosophy to some pupils in the morning. He had a
			walk with Swami Premananda, a brother-disciple, and gave him instructions
			concerning the future of the Ramakrishna Math. He left his body (died) in
			the evening after a session of prayer at Belur Math. He was 39.
			Vivekananda had fulfilled his own prophecy of not living to be forty-years
			old.
			<br />
		</p>
		<h2>Holy Mother's temple</h2>
		<p>
			The Holy Mother's temple is dedicated to Sarada Devi, the spiritual
			consort of Ramakrishna. The holy mother's temple is right at the entrance
			of Belur Math. The temple is over the area where her mortal remains were
			consigned to flames. The temple of the Holy Mother was consecrated on 21
			December 1921.
			<br />
		</p>
		<h2>Ramakrishna Museum</h2>
		<img src="Ramakrishna_Marble_Statue.jpg" / id="ramkrishna">
		<p>
			The famed, two-storey Ramakrishna Museum hosts artifacts used by
			Ramakrishna, Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, and some of his disciples.
			These include the long coat worn by Vivekananda in the West, Sister
			Nivedita's table, and an organ of Mrs Sevier's. The museum chronicles the
			contemporary growth of the movement, and the Bengalese.
			<br />
			The museum has a realistic recreation of the Panchavati — the clutch of
			five sacred trees of the Dakshineswar Kali Temple where Ramakrishna
			practised sadhana (spiritual disciplines). The black stone bowl from which
			Ramakrishna took payasam (a sweet Indian dish) during his final days,
			while suffering from throat cancer, and the pillow he had used, in the
			house in Calcutta where he spent his last few months, are on display.
			Ramakrishna's room in the house, where he distributed ochre clothes to 12
			disciples anointing Vivekananda (then Narendranath) as their leader, has
			also been shown with a model of Ramakrishna bestowing grace on his
			disciples, and the footwear used by Ramakrishna has been put on the model.
			The room at Dakshineswar where Ramakrishna lived has been recreated with
			display of clothes and other objects used by him, the tanpura used by
			Vivekananda to sing to his master, and the copies of two charcoal drawings
			sketched by Ramakrishna are on display.
			<br />
		</p>
		<h2>Activities</h2>
		<p>
			The Belur Math conducts medical service, education, work for women, rural
			uplift and work among the labouring and backward classes, relief,
			spiritual and cultural activities. The center also celebrates annual
			birthdays of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Sarada Devi and other monastic
			disciples of Ramakrishna. The annual celebrations of Kumari Puja and Durga
			Puja are one of the main attractions. The tradition of Kumari puja was
			started by Vivekananda in 1901.
