		<h2>Kila Nizamat</h2>
		<p>
			Kila Nizamat or Nizamat Kila (Nizamat Fort) was the site of the old fort
			of Murshidabad. It was located on the present site of the Hazarduari
			Prasad, on the banks of the Bhagirathi river.

		<h2>Etymology</h2>
		<p>
			The name of the palace that is Hazarduari means "a palace with a thousand
			doors". Hazar means "thousand" and Duari means "the one with doors"; thus,
			the total sums up to "the one with a thousand doors".
			<br />
			The palace earlier known as Bara Kothi has been named so as the palace has
			in all 1000 doors, of which 100 are false. They were built so that if any
			predator tried to do something wrong and escape, he would be confused
			between the false and real doors, and by that time he would be caught by
			the Nawab's guards.

		<h2>Museum</h2>
		<p>
			The palace has now been transformed into a museum which houses collections
			from the Nawabs like priceless paintings, furniture, antiques and so on.
			The famous one is the mirror and the chandelier. In 1985, the palace was
			handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India for better preservation.
			<br />
		</p>
		<h2>Miniature</h2>
		<p>
			A miniature of the palace, made by Sagore Mistri in ivory, along with
			portraits of His Highness and his son, among other presents, were sent to
			King William IV. He honoured the Nawab with a full-size portrait of His
			Majesty and an autographed letter, and conferred upon him the badge and
			insignia of the Royal Guelphic and Hanoverian order, which are still
			preserved in the Palace.
