		<p>
			The <b>Saheed Minar</b> (English: Martyrs' Monument), formerly known as
			the <b>Ochterlony Monument</b>, is a monument in Kolkata that was erected
			in 1828 in memory of Major-general Sir David Ochterlony, commander of the
			British East India Company, to commemorate both his successful defense of
			Delhi against the Marathas in 1804 and the victory of the East India
			Company's armed forces over the Gurkhas in the Anglo-Nepalese War, also
			known as the Gurkha War. The monument was constructed in his memory. It
			was designed by J. P. Parker and paid for from public funds. <br /><br />
			On 9 August 1969, it was rededicated to the memory of the martyrs of the
			Indian freedom movement and renamed the "Saheed Minar", which means
			"martyrs' monument" in both Bengali and Hindi, by the then United Front
			Government in memory of the martyrs of the Indian independence movement.
			The present government has decided to illuminate the tower during evenings
			and allow visitors to the top. The last people to have been up there were
			former governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and his family.

			balconies at the top. The top floor of the minar is accessible by a

		<h2>Saheed Minar Maidan</h2>

		<p>
			The vast field to the south of Saheed Minar, is known as the Saheed Minar
			Maidan or the Brigade Ground. It has a history of being the site of
			political rallies and fairs. The first political meeting on the ground was
			presided over by Rabindranath Tagore to condemn the killing of a youth in
			Hijli by the British in 1931. The central bus terminus of the city is
			around[clarification needed] the monument.
			<br />
		</p>
		<h2>Public use</h2>
		<p>
			In 1997, a tourist jumped off the lower balcony of the monument. Since
			then, police permission is required to climb the steps of the monument.
			Local residents must submit proof of address and a photo ID at the
			Lalbazar Police Headquarters, while out-of-town tourists must submit
			documents from their hotel, and foreigners must submit a copy of their
			passport.
			<br />
			The monument offers a bird's-eye view of the city. The government has
			planned to open the monument to the public, after the renovation work is
			completed. The renovation work was started in late 2011 and will be
			completed in two phases. The first phase was scheduled to be completed by
			June 15, 2012, and is said to cost about ₹50 lakhs. There are also plans
			to illuminate the monument, both from inside and outside, and to give the
			monument a fresh coat of paint. In the second phase a temporary folding
			stage will be set up at the foot of the 48-metre (157 ft) tall monument to
			avoid congestion at the Dorina Crossing during rallies.
			<br />
			After the work is completed, both tourists and locals will have access to
			the top of the monument. Stalls selling souvenirs will also be set up just
			in front of the monument, while the pathways leading to it will be cleaned
			and decorated with flowering plants.
